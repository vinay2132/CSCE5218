    "    A) It is not needed to train the whole training dataset to get accuracy with the test dataset. Even though increasing the training dataset amount will improve the accuracy and model generalization this will become stable at a certain point. So it is not necessary to have a complete training dataset but the chosen set of data needs to be clean with no noisy data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    B) The accuracy decrease in the second set of code may depend on several factors one of the most possible things is adding some more data into the training dataset and the data that was added may be noicy or unclean data making the model slow and hard to handle. Coming to the second reason is the lower learning rate and this may cause the model to converge more slowly or to get stuck in local minima.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    C) Increasing the accuracy with the help of additional hyperparameters depends on different factors like the complexity of the dataset, the efficiency of the algorithms, and model architecture. Things like feature engineering, and ensemble learning may also affect the increase the accuracy. In addition to this hyperparameter tuning like grid search and random search might also affect the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    D)No it is not always right to train more epochs while keeping the other hyperparameters fixed. This might lead to the problem of overfitting the model basically this is that it trains the data instead of generalizing the unseen dataset. Increasing the epochs will increase the cost of the computational process without affecting the model performance and this is called the process of overfitting of the model. The required number of epochs can be done by using the methods like cross-validation technique will help in this process of selecting the right number of epochs for a particular model.\n",
